## Summary 
Given the [anime dataset](ttps://www.kaggle.com/alancmathew/anime-dataset?select=anime.csv) from Kaggle, my goal is to evaluate the data to explore different trends. The dataset includes information like anime title, season of release, year of release, ratings, genres, etc.

## Scope
The first plan of action is to import the csv file to create a dataframe using Pandas and work on cleaning the data. For example, converting strings into integers or lists.
