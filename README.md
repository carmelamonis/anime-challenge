## Summary 
Given the [anime dataset](ttps://www.kaggle.com/alancmathew/anime-dataset?select=anime.csv) from Kaggle, my goal is to evaluate the data to explore different trends. The dataset includes information like anime title, season of release, year of release, ratings, genres, etc. Anime has had a huge growth in popularity compared to the earlier times. Many popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Amazon Video now have many animes available to watch.


## Scope
The first plan of action is to import the csv file to create a dataframe using Pandas and work on cleaning the data. For example, converting strings into integers or lists.
